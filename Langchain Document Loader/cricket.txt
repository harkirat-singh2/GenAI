Cricket wakes with the sun on a dusty field,
White lines drawn like promises on earth,
Leather whispers against polished willow,
And a bowler marks his silent path.

The crowd hums like a distant storm,
Hope stitched into every jersey,
A coin spins beneath a restless sky,
Choosing fate in a fleeting second.

The first ball cuts through morning air,
Seam upright, proud and precise,
The bat answers with a sharp crack,
Echoing across eager hearts.

Runs trickle like patient rivers,
Fielders chase like hunters in wind,
Sweat beads beneath the helmet’s shade,
Strategy blooms in captain’s eyes.

A cover drive paints the grass,
Grace written in a single stroke,
Applause rises like birds in flight,
Feathers of joy scattered wide.

Spin dances upon worn patches,
Mystery curling in dusty arcs,
Batsmen lean into quiet doubt,
Feet searching for certain ground.

Fast bowlers thunder from afar,
Rhythm pounding through their stride,
The wicketkeeper crouches low,
Gloves open like waiting wings.

An edge flies thin as a whisper,
Slip cordon breathes in unison,
Leather kisses grateful palms,
And celebration bursts like flame.

Scoreboards flicker with fragile hope,
Numbers building fragile towers,
Partnerships weave silent trust,
Brick by careful brick of patience.

Midday heat presses heavy,
Shadows shorten in stubborn light,
Drinks carried like sacred relief,
Laughter cooling tired nerves.

A pull shot storms the boundary rope,
Crowds erupt in roaring tides,
Flags ripple in fevered rhythm,
Voices rise in shared heartbeat.

Yet wickets fall like autumn leaves,
Sudden, sharp, and humbling,
Silence sweeps the cheering stands,
Leaving only nervous prayers.

A captain gathers scattered focus,
Field spreads like chess across green,
Every move a whispered gamble,
Every glance a coded plan.

In twilight’s golden hush,
The match tightens like a knot,
Runs needed, balls diminishing,
Tension stitched in every breath.

A six arcs into fading light,
Stars applauding from above,
The crowd forgets the weight of time,
Living only in this moment.

Last over, hearts in throats,
Bowler grips destiny in fingers,
Batsman steadies trembling pulse,
History waiting in silence.

The final strike splits the air,
Ball racing toward forever,
Cheers crashing like monsoon rain,
Victory blooming in wild embrace.

And when the stadium lights dim,
And footprints fade from the pitch,
Cricket lingers in whispered tales,
A game, a dream, a nation’s pulse. 🏏
